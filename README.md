# Mortgage Calculator
This is a very simple Java application that performs basic fixed mortgage calculations. The purpose of this application is not to provide precise financial calculations but rather to demonstrate:
* flow of control using a *while* loop
* the use of a class *constructor* to initialize member variables
* numeric aggregation using a *for* loop
* argument validation
* the use of the standard error stream (*System.err*)

This code is provided as-is.
